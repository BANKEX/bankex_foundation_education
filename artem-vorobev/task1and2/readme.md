# Thas just files from the different plases in github

Files:

- SimpleToken.sol - is solution for Task1 - ERC20 token implementation
- BasicNFT.sol is - is solution for Task2 - ERC: Non-fungible Token Standard#721 implementation 

I've took implementation from the next resources:


ERC20:

ERC: Non-fungible Token Standard #721:

- https://github.com/ethereum/eips/issues/721
